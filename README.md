## 🎯 Deliverable 1: Objective and Introduction
The project focuses on the **Modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (mKP) equation**, a partial differential equation that models wave phenomena in **two dimensions**, particularly:
- Ion-acoustic waves in plasmas.  
- Wave propagation in fluid dynamics and geophysics.  

The main objective:  
- Convert the **second-order ODE of the mKP equation** into a **system of first-order ODEs**.  
- Implement a **MATLAB program** that simulates the behavior of the equation based on **user-provided values** (e.g., direction cosines, wave speed).

## 📐 Deliverable 2: Analytical Solution
- Defined new variables:
  - `l` → cosine direction along x-axis.  
  - `m` → cosine direction along z-axis.  
  - `U` → wave speed.  
- Substituted these variables into the mKP equation.  
- Performed **integration and differentiation** to simplify into a first-order system.  
- Applied **laws of conservation of mass, energy, and momentum** under a finite domain assumption.

## 💻 Deliverable 3: MATLAB Code
- MATLAB program created to:  
  - Accept user inputs for cosines and wave speed.  
  - Simulate wave behavior based on the mKP system.  
- Code includes visualization for **quantitative analysis**.

## 📊 Deliverable 4: MATLAB Solution and Results
- The MATLAB simulation generates **animations and snapshots** of wave behavior.  
- Snapshots were taken at **random intervals** for comparison.  
- Results confirm that the simulation matches the **analytical hand solution**.
